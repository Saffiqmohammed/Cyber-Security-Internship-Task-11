# Task 11: Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection

## Objective
To understand phishing attacks, create phishing email templates, set up a landing page, send test phishing emails, track responses, identify red flags, learn prevention methods, and document the simulation.

## Tools Used
- GoPhish
- Manual phishing templates (HTML)

## Steps Performed

### 1. Understanding Phishing Attacks
Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, OTPs, and banking details.

### 2. Create Fake Email Template
A fake login alert email template was created to simulate a phishing attack scenario.

### 3. Setup Landing Page
A fake login page was created to capture credentials for testing purposes.

### 4. Send Test Phishing Email
Test phishing emails were sent to dummy email accounts using GoPhish.

### 5. Track Responses
GoPhish dashboard was used to track email opened, link clicked, and credentials submitted.

### 6. Identify Red Flags
- Unknown sender email address  
- Urgent or threatening messages  
- Suspicious links  
- Spelling and grammar mistakes  

### 7. Learn Prevention Methods
- Security awareness training  
- Email spam filters  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- Verifying suspicious emails and links  

## Conclusion
Phishing simulations help organizations and individuals to understand social engineering attacks and improve cybersecurity awareness.
